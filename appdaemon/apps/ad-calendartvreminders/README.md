# :tv::calendar: Calendar TV Reminders :chicken:

If you're like me :sleeping:, who forgets important days in the year, like a friends birthday :birthday:, anniversary :gift:, or an insurance due date :motorcycle: etc; say hello to the Calendar TV Reminders :tv::calendar: App. This app will (like a faithful assistant) keep reminding you **every time you turn on your TV** about any upcoming event(s) in the next 15 days. We all turn on our TVs atleast once a day, so there is absolutly no chance that you will ever forget an important day of the year if your TV is the one reminding you about it :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

This app has been a lifesaver. My family and friends are now plesantly surprised at how good I am at remembering birthdays. Little do they know ;)

## Installation
**Needs the following integrations to work**

Use [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) or [download](https://github.com/UbhiTS/ad-tvcalendarreminders) the `calendar_tv_notifications.py` from inside the `apps` directory to your local `apps` directory, and add the configuration to enable the app.

### Configuration (config/appdaemon/apps/apps.yaml)

## Thank you! :raised_hands:
If you like my work and feel gracious, you can buy me a beer below ;)

Currently tested and working with LG WebOS Smart TVs, but hopefully it will work with other Smart TVs. If your TV does not work, feel free to log a bug or CR to the repo and I'll try to get it working at the earliest.
