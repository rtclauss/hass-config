I moved the NUC to the same room as the fans for the initial pairing.  After they were on the network they communicate over the Zigbee mesh proper.

* [Generic OBDII GPRS Real Time Tracker](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32981833499.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.1bfa4c4dpn9kUy)


**AppDaemon Apps:**
* [Bayesian Device Tracker](appdaemon/apps/tracker.py) - Merges GPS location info with bayesian binary sensor to give ground-truth location tracking.  Uses bayesian data to eliminate red-herrings when arriving at home.  Could be extended to other zones if you have multiple `device_tracker`s 
* [Lighting Fade-In](appdaemon/apps/brighten_lights.py) - Fades in lights from `off` over a pre-defined interval on a work (non-weekend, non-holiday) day.
* [Music Fade-in](appdaemon/apps/fade_in_music.py) - Fades in music when I wake up in the morning
* [deConz button events](appdaemon/apps/deconz_helper.py) - Translates Xiaomi button events into a generic sensor.
* [Magic Cube](appdaemon/apps/magic_cube.py) - Translates Xiaomi Magic Cube events into actions controlling my living room Hue lights
* [Automatic event helper](appdaemon/apps/automatic_helper.py) - Similar to deCONZ helper this translates matic events into a generic sensor.
* [Nest Travel helper](appdaemon/apps/nest_travel_helper.py) - When driving long distances the Nest will switch from heating/cooling back to away mode if you don't arrive home soon enough.  This listens for those changes and keeps Nest from switching back to away mode.

**Apple Shortcuts**
* [Set wakeup time](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/61be3701823f444dbae0de1626020025) - Slowly turn on bedroom lights in the morning before a meeting
