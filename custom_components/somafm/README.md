# SomaFM integration for Home Assistant
This Home Assistant integration adds all SomaFM stations to the media player.\
SomaFM stations are a regular audio media resource, so can be cast or listened to in-tab.

This integration loads SomaFM's current stations upon load, so the listings are always up-to-date.
